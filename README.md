**Black-box integration testing for Angular made easy.**

Ngx-testbox empowers developers to write integration tests with **minimal setup** and **maximum reliability**.  
Abstract away internal implementation details and focus on what actually mattersâ€”your feature's behavior as seen by the user.

## Key Benefits

- **Black-box by design**  
  Focus on inputs and outputs, not the internals. Tests remain concise, maintainable, and stable.

- **Deterministic async control**  
  Leveraging Angularâ€™s Zone, `ngx-testbox` waits for your app to stabilizeâ€”HTTP calls complete, DOM settledâ€”before assertions continue.

- **UX-centric testing**  
  Ensure what users actually see is what matters. Internal state isn't enough if the UI doesn't reflect it.

- **Test-Driven Development friendly**  
  Write tests first using your REST API contract and UI expectations; implement logic laterâ€”boosts confidence and speed.

## Getting Started

```bash

npm install ngx-testbox --save-dev

```

Or using yarn

```bash

yarn add ngx-testbox --dev

```

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { fakeAsync } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { DebugElementHarness, predefinedHttpCallInstructions, runTasksUntilStable } from 'ngx-testbox/testing';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  let harness: DebugElementHarness<typeof testIds>;

  beforeEach(() => {
    // setup TestBed, component, and harness
  });

  it('should display data on success', fakeAsync(() => {
    const mockData = [{ id: 1, name: 'Item A' }];

    runTasksUntilStable(fixture, {
      httpCallInstructions: [
        predefinedHttpCallInstructions.get.success('/api/items', mockData)
      ]
    });

    const items = harness.elements.item.queryAll();
    expect(items.length).toBe(1);
    expect(harness.elements.itemText.getTextContent(items[0])).toContain('Item A');
  }));
});
```

## Continuous Integration

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. The workflow:
- Runs on every push to main/master branches and pull requests
- Builds the library
- Runs tests for all projects with code coverage
- Uploads coverage reports as artifacts

You can see the workflow status in the Actions tab of the repository.
